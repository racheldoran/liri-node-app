# liri-node-app

Liri kind of like Siri but its not, is a bot I created that pulls data using axios. For example, you can ask Liri to spotify a song and then baddabing baddaboom it appears.;)

In my code, I have sectioned different axios calls for spotify, OMBd and Bands in Town that pulls the data from certain requests you ask Liri. Inside those said calls, I have console logged different responses that specifically pull information to see in the terminal. 

So as far as issues go, Bands in Town keeps throwing an 403 error message and I'm not sure how to fix it just yet however, Spotify and OMBd are working fine. I have included screenshots and a video below. Still working on it don't worry! ;)
