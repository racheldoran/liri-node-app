# liri-node-app

Liri kind of like Siri but its not, is a bot I created that pulls data using axios. For example, you can ask Liri to spotify a song and then baddabing baddaboom it appears.;)

In my code, I have sectioned different axios calls for spotify, OMBd and Bands in Town that pulls the data from certain requests you ask Liri. Inside those said calls, I have console logged different responses that specifically pull information to see in the terminal.
